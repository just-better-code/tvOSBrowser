# User Guide — tvOSofaBrowse

Current for **2.18.23**. Button names match the application.

## Quick start

Use a Siri Remote with a touch surface or touch-enabled clickpad. A button-only remote cannot move the browser pointer.

1. Open the browser. On New Tab, choose a Favorite or history entry, or press Back/Menu to open the main menu.
2. The domain/address button receives initial menu focus. Press Center to enter an address or search query.
3. Slide on the touchpad to move the pointer and press Center to click a page control.
4. Press Up/Down to scroll. Hold a direction for continuous, smoothly accelerating scrolling. Touchpad movement controls the pointer; swiping does not scroll the page.

Open the visual quick guide through **Menu → Tools → User Guide**. **Show this guide at launch** uses the same ON/OFF badge as the browser menu and controls whether it appears at startup.

## Siri Remote controls

| Action | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Move the pointer | Slide on the touchpad |
| Click a link or button | Center |
| Scroll a page | Up/Down; hold to accelerate |
| Navigate tab history | Back/Forward in the six-button row below the address |
| Open the tab overview | Double Left |
| Close the focused overview tab | Double Up or Play/Pause |
| Toggle the magnifier on a website | Hold Center |
| Open the menu or return from an overlay | Back/Menu, depending on context |
| Play/pause supported video | Play/Pause |

On app-owned pages, arrows move selection and Center activates the focused item. Hold Center for its context actions; Play/Pause performs the page's shortcut. Website controls retain their own behavior. The pointer hides on inactivity; a new touchpad movement brings it back.

### Back/Menu behavior

- On an ordinary page, open the main menu.
- In a menu, dialog, guide or tab overview, close that screen.
- In a torrent's file list, return to the overall torrent list; from the overall list, return to the browser.
- On New Tab, return to the previously active tab when available.
- With the magnifier enabled, turn it off before opening the menu.
- In a supported fullscreen player, leave fullscreen and return to the page.

Use Back/Forward below the address to navigate browser history. Left/Right on a page are reserved for video and do not open another page.

## Main menu

The domain button is focused when the menu opens, so Center immediately opens address editing.

The address spans the top of the menu. Below it, the six-button row contains **Back**, **Forward**, **Home**, **Reload Page**, **New Tab** and **Tabs**. Back/Forward use the active tab's history.

| Section | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Quick Actions | Zoom Out, Reset Zoom, Zoom In, Add Favorite, History, Torrents |
| Settings | Ad Block, Magnifier, Full Screen Player, Keep Alive, Mobile Site |
| Tools | Clear Cache, Clear Cookies, Clear History, Debug, User Guide |

Quick Actions, Settings and the three Clear commands use three columns. In the last row, Debug takes one column and User Guide spans two. Clear commands are highlighted pink only when focused.

Zoom ranges from **50% to 200%**, in **10%** steps. It scales the text and page together, starts at the left edge after a change, and remembers the chosen percentage separately for each top-level domain across tabs and launches. Domains without a saved setting start at 100%; different subdomains have separate settings. Reset Zoom shows the current percentage, updates after each zoom action, and restores **100%** for the current domain when pressed. Mobile Site changes the User Agent; presentation depends on the website.

Press Center on **Ad Block** to switch protection on or off. Hold Center to open its settings popup. The master Ad Block toggle sits beside the **Settings** heading without an extra container; the list below switches the [AdGuard DNS filter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter) and [AdGuard Base, Ukrainian, Social Media, Mobile Ads, and Annoyances filters](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/) separately. Every toggle uses the browser menu's green ON or gray OFF badge. A filter badge sits at the right edge of its row, with its version just before it, or an update date if the list has no version. Downloading and errors appear in the same row; a failed update keeps its cached copy. **Update Filters Now** sits to the left of **Done** below the filter controls. While Ad Block is on, enabled filters download directly on the Apple TV, check for updates weekly, and remain cached for later launches. On later launches, unchanged filters reuse their compiled WebKit rules without converting the lists again; missing compiled rules are rebuilt from the cached filters. Browser filter rules are converted with [SafariConverterLib](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/SafariConverterLib) to support network and native cosmetic rules; rules requiring a Safari extension runtime are not applied. If one filter's rules fail to compile, other successfully compiled filters remain active. Ad Block also suppresses script-opened external windows. A bundled custom-rules file blocks the observed Hraimo banner source across websites and is reserved for requested gaps in online filters; changing it requires a new app installation. If the first download is unavailable, protection from online lists starts when a download succeeds. Ads inserted directly into a video stream may remain. If Ad Block interferes with a page or player, disable it and reload.

Remaining pointer alignment and website layout issues are tracked in the local roadmap.

The magnifier is also available through Settings → Magnifier. It turns off after **30 seconds without cursor activity**. Moving the cursor does not re-enable it; toggle it manually. Cursor movement is half as sensitive in magnifier mode for precise targeting.

## Tabs and New Tab

- Open the overview with **Tabs** or Double Left.
- Select a tab card and press Center to open it.
- The **+** card opens New Tab; an empty New Tab does not occupy a saved tab slot.
- Play/Pause closes the focused ordinary tab in the overview.
- Hold Center on a tab card for Open and Close actions.
- Double Up also closes the focused overview tab; repeated Up presses on a page scroll it.

The native New Tab page shows **Favorites** and recent history across the available screen width. Center opens an entry. **Play/Pause or Hold Center opens the selected entry's options**: Favorite actions or recent-visit actions.

The session saves ordinary tabs, the active tab and each tab's Back/Forward list. An empty New Tab is temporary and is not restored as an ordinary page.

If the active webpage's WebKit process terminates while the app is in the foreground, the browser automatically reloads it. It allows two automatic attempts during a burst of crashes, then stops to avoid a reload loop. After 60 seconds without another termination, automatic attempts are available again. You can still use Reload manually. Background tabs are not automatically reloaded.

## Favorites

1. Open the page to save.
2. Choose **Menu → Quick Actions → Add Favorite**.
3. Review the title and address, then save.

On New Tab, select a Favorite and press Play/Pause for editing and deletion options. Favorites are stored locally.

## History

**Menu → Quick Actions → History** lists up to 20 recent addresses. Choose **All History** for the complete list.

### All History

| Action | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Open an entry | Select its row and press Center |
| Select/deselect a row | Play/Pause on the row |
| Open row actions | Hold Center on the row |
| Select every entry | Select All |
| Open one selected entry | Open; exactly one row must be selected |
| Delete selected entries | Delete |
| Clear all visits | Clear All, then confirm |
| Close the list | Done or Back/Menu |

**Clear History** in the main menu also clears visits after confirmation. History is not automatically deleted by age.

## Video

- Use Center on the player's own controls under the pointer.
- Use Play/Pause to pause or resume supported video.
- Use Left/Right to seek supported video by **10 seconds**.
- A website's fullscreen button can expand its player with a dimmed background while retaining the cursor, Play/Pause and Back.
- **Settings → Full Screen Player** enables a separate tvOS player for an accessible direct media URL. It is not needed for expanding a website's own player.
- Use Back/Menu to leave a supported fullscreen mode.

The browser forwards clicks into supported iframe players, including cross-origin frames inside web components. Point at the player's Play, episode selector or fullscreen button and press Center.

Availability depends on the player, stream format and website. A pure canvas player without accessible video does not have guaranteed seeking support. DRM and unsupported formats may prevent playback.

## Torrents

Select a magnet or `.torrent` link on a website to open **Torrents** immediately. The library focuses the imported torrent in the overall list; press Center to open its files. Its row shows selected and total size, transfer rates, peer counts, and focusable Download All, Priority Up, and Priority Down icons beside the focused row. Play/Pause on a torrent row also starts all its files. Hold Center for Pause/Resume, Reset Torrent, and Remove Torrent. Priority order is saved across launches.

New torrents start with files skipped. Center opens a folder, and Back returns to its parent; Play/Pause on a folder selects every file inside it for download. The download icon to the right of a focused file or folder selects it without starting playback. A playable file also shows a VLC app icon beside the download icon; press Center on it to open the file in an installed VLC app. The VLC icon is dim if VLC is not installed or Settings → Keep Alive is off, and pressing it explains what to enable. The file row still opens the built-in player by default. Hold Center on a folder for **Download Folder** or **Skip Folder**. Center or Play/Pause on a focused playable file starts **Play Now (Priority)**. Hold Center on a file for Play Now and Download/Skip actions, or on a torrent for Open Files and Pause/Resume. The player offers MP4, M4V, MOV, MP3, M4A, MKV and AVI files. If libtorrent is checking an existing file, playback waits for that check; otherwise it starts as verified pieces arrive. The status header shows **Buffering · Complete: XX%** or **Streaming · Complete: XX%** while visible, and the header hides with the controls after inactivity during playback. The format and codec still need to be supported by the embedded player and Apple TV hardware. The bottom panel has progress and one row of round playback controls with compact Audio and Subtitles selectors. Focus Audio or Subtitles and press Center to choose an available track or Off; the selectors become available after VLC discovers tracks in the file. Press Center to show the controls again; touchpad direction gestures do not seek while the controls are hidden. A short Center press on a seek button jumps 10 or 30 seconds. Holding Center on it repeats 20- or 60-second jumps until release; after ten seconds of holding a 30-second button, its repeated jump becomes 120 seconds. This hold action does not open the player's context menu. Previous returns to the start of the current file when more than five seconds have played, or opens the previous playable file near the start. Play/Pause toggles playback, Back/Menu returns to the library, and playback pauses when the app becomes inactive. VLC saves a position for each torrent file and resumes there on the next opening; a finished file starts from the beginning next time.

All new torrents wait for manual file selection or Download All. Playing a file enables that file; use its right-hand download icon or Hold Center → **Download File** to transfer one file without opening the player.

From a torrent's file list, choose **Skip Download** to stop requesting that file, or use **Pause/Resume** to control the torrent. Skipping a completed file does not erase its downloaded bytes; libtorrent 1.2 has no safe individual-file removal action in this app. In the overall list, Hold Center and choose **Reset Torrent** to delete its downloaded files, retain its `.torrent` or magnet source, and restore the entry with all files skipped. **Remove Torrent** deletes its entry and cached files. Both actions also clear that torrent's playback positions. The hint beside the action shortcuts shows the total torrent cache size, which includes listed torrents. **Reset All** applies Reset Torrent to every listed torrent: it removes downloaded files and playback positions, retains sources, and re-adds entries with all files skipped. **Delete All**, beside Reset All, removes every listed torrent and its cached files and playback positions. Both actions require confirmation. This action does not touch browser history or website data. Torrent payloads and metadata are in tvOS's purgeable cache, so the system may remove them when space is needed. **Settings → Keep Alive** is experimental and does not guarantee background downloading.

### Background downloads

Torrent transfers continue while the app is active, including when Torrents is closed and you browse websites. Experimental **Settings → Keep Alive** can let a manually started torrent continue downloading after you leave the browser. tvOS may still suspend or interrupt the browser, so this does not guarantee every transfer will finish. The app can also request system-managed Background App Refresh and Background Processing time for manually started, incomplete torrents; tvOS decides whether and when to grant it. Keep the app open for a download that must continue without interruption.

**Menu → Tools → Debug** toggles diagnostics with Center; hold Center to open its options with a **Debug ON/OFF** button at the top, plus **Recent Diagnostic Logs** and **Background Probe** report buttons below. Debug is the single master switch for app console logs, website logging, numeric torrent/background diagnostics, and the temporary background probe. Turning it off stops an active probe and cancels probe-only background requests without stopping torrent downloads. Saved reports remain readable while Debug is off; collecting fresh media or WebKit diagnostics requires Debug on. **Debug → Recent Diagnostic Logs** shows the ten latest numeric diagnostic lines; **Debug → Background Probe** shows elapsed background time, timer-covered execution time, and the longest timer gap without requiring a torrent. It also records whether **Keep Alive** was on when measurement began. A long elapsed interval with little active time means the app was suspended. In Debug builds with Debug enabled, a probe-only request is submitted even if no torrent is pending; ordinary releases submit tasks only for manually started, incomplete torrents.

### Episode, season and playback position

The website saves this state, for example through cookies or localStorage. Tabs share a persistent WebKit data store so the website can read its data after another launch.

There is no separate backup of player state. If the website does not save the episode selection or its data is deleted, the browser cannot reconstruct it. Page scroll restoration also depends on content loading; a reported case of failed scroll restoration remains unresolved.

## Local storage and recovery

The browser automatically saves history, Favorites and tab sessions in a local database and refreshes its compressed backup. At startup, it attempts recovery from a valid copy if the main database is missing, empty or damaged. No backup toggle is required.

- The backup includes visits, Favorites and tab navigation.
- Cookies, localStorage and player data are not included.
- Explicit history deletion updates the backup so deleted entries should not return during recovery.
- The copy is stored in application preferences. iCloud was rejected; Firefox Account synchronization is planned but unavailable.
- Removing the application also removes the local copy.
- The main database and website data store use Caches. The system can clear these files; the database backup protects history, not website data.
- If a compressed snapshot exceeds the available preferences budget, a new backup is not written. History is not automatically trimmed to make it fit.

## Clearing data

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Clear Cache | Remove WebKit resource caches and reload; do not deliberately clear other saved website data |
| Clear Cookies | Remove cookies and reload; this may sign you out |
| Clear History | Delete visits after confirmation |

## Diagnostic logging

Press Center on **Menu → Tools → Debug** to toggle diagnostics using its green ON / gray OFF badge. Hold Center on Debug to open its options, styled like Ad Block settings with the same **Debug ON/OFF** button at the top. There are no separate logging or probe switches.

- Activate the item to toggle website and numeric torrent/background diagnostics together.
- The choice survives relaunch; diagnostics are initially enabled.
- The change takes effect immediately without reloading.
- OFF stops new entries from these loggers; it does not delete old entries or silence all application logs.

Website logging helps investigate storage and player behavior. It records localStorage key names and lengths, not localStorage or cookie values. Episode and season diagnostics depend on the information exposed by the player. **Recent Diagnostic Logs** shows the latest ten numeric entries from the shared diagnostic logger; **Background Probe** shows the last recorded background interval.

For local inspection, the application container contains `Library/Caches/BrowserWebsiteDiagnostics.log`. The rotated file has the `.previous` suffix. Debug also provides media diagnostics.

## Troubleshooting

- **A website does not open:** check the address, reload, and try Mobile Site or disabling Ad Block.
- **Video does not play:** try page playback and fullscreen; format or DRM limitations may apply.
- **Episode selection resets:** enable Diagnostics, reproduce the issue and record the website, episode and restart method. Avoid clearing data before diagnosis.
- **History is missing:** recovery runs when the database opens; success depends on a valid local copy being available.

See the [README](../README.md) for an overview. Local project plans and development history live in the ignored `docs/agent/` directory.

### Native video diagnostic privacy

Native playback and extraction diagnostics omit object payloads such as URLs, headers, response bodies, and error descriptions. Events containing these values show redacted placeholders; numeric-only diagnostic events retain their values. Website logging follows the Debug diagnostics toggle. Review any diagnostic output before sharing it publicly.
